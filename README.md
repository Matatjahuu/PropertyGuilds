## Guild system for Minecraft 1.13.2 server
![PropertyGuilds](https://i.imgur.com/QWu1DYg.png)
#
**Description**
```
Guild system that operates fully asynchronously, meaning it does not block the server's main thread (XD). 
This allows the guild system to function faster and more smoothly, and the server can handle more players.
This plugin enables the creation and management of in-game guilds, including adding and removing players, setting guild ranks, establishing guild points, and much more. 
All of these features are available in-game, allowing players to fully utilize the guild system without the need for logging onto a website or using other tools.
The plugin operates fully asynchronously, so no additional configuration or settings are required, making it easy and quick to add the guild system to a Minecraft server. 
Additionally, the plugin is optimized for performance, meaning it uses minimal server resources and can handle large numbers of players simultaneously.
With this Minecraft plugin featuring a guild system, significant amounts of server resources can be saved, allowing even up to 1000 players on a server!!! 
The guild system also promotes player engagement in the game by adding new goals and opportunities, such as earning guild points, advancing to higher ranks, and battling other guilds.
